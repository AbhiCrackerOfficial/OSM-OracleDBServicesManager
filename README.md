# OSM-OracleDBServicesManager

OSM-OracleDBServicesManager (OSM) is a batch script tool designed to simplify the management of Oracle Database services on Windows systems. With a user-friendly interface, OSM enables users to easily start, stop, and manage OracleDB services with just a few clicks. Whether you're a database administrator or a developer, OSM streamlines the process of handling OracleDB services, saving you time and effort.
